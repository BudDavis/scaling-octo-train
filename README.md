What Technology to use?

Java:  
    Multiplatform +
    Lots of libs  +
    slow runtime  -  (who cares)


Fltk:
    Moves slow +
    still relies on OS installed libs  -


GTK4:
    Moves fast -
    C          -

QT:
    political a mess -
    moves fast       -

Node:
    no knowledge     -
    lightest install +
